# azure-arc-enabled-sql-server-accelerator
A delicious casserole of code to accelerate Arc-enabled SQL Server Extension deployment in your environment.

Credit for the the SQL Server Dashboard goes to Microsoft; it was taken from their existing SQL Samples here on GitHub - all I did was turn it into an ARM template for easier deployment.

Credit for the SQL Server Azure Monitor workbooks goes to Raúl Carboneras - like the dashboard, all I did was turn it into an ARM template. Go check out his stuff here:
